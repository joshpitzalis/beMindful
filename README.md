# beMindful
A simple timer that measure meditation frequency, consistency and duration.

+ The plan for this project is just to make a simple meditation online timer.
+ Once this works, plan to add accounts so that you can keep a record of the duration and frequency of your sessions.
+ Then I would like to connect this to the [exist.io](https://exist.io/) api so that you can see track what kind of an affect meditation is having on your life.
+ Then I would like to connect to the [beeminder.com](https://www.beeminder.com/) api so that you can commit to meditating more often and stay accountable.

I plan to use Meteor and React. This will make it easy to wrap the web app into something you can use on android and an iPhone.

There is no estimated deadline, squeezing this in around my other commitments. Will add all updates here.

For the first stage I'm keeping it simple. A start button, a stop button, and a button that shows you the total time at the end.

The design is based entirely on [the Do app from IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/products/do/button) and the honey pot icons is from [Yorlmar Campos](https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=bee&i=43723).
